To run the simple registration form using HTML, CSS, and MongoDB, execute "node index.js" in your terminal. This command establishes a connection to the MongoDB database. Then, fill out the form with relevant information. Upon submission, the data will be stored in the database for retrieval and management. This process integrates front-end design (HTML/CSS), back-end functionality (Node.js), and database storage (MongoDB) for efficient user registration and data handling.
